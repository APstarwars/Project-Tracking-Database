# Project-Tracking-Database
A Software Development Project for CS 370 at Sonoma State University.

A web server application created for a hypothetical industry setting.
In many engineering companies, paperwork relating to customers and projects for those customers is disorganized at best and hard to find at worst. These companies could benefit from a central storage system that allows cross-collaboration and easy viewing by all parties. This application aims to create a central database that stores paperwork on a network, allowing for easy access by any authorized user.
